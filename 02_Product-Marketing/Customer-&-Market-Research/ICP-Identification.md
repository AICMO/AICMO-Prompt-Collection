Core Problem It Solves:

[In one or two sentences, what is the primary pain point or need your product addresses for a customer?]

2. [e.g., Automates a manual 10-hour/week process]

YOUR TASK

Follow this strict, three-step methodology to identify and justify the best potential ICPs.
Find N = 10 ICPs for B2B and same number for B2C if both can be covered.

Step 1: Market-Wide Sector Brainstorming
Based on the product's core value propositions, brainstorm a broad list of potential industry sectors or customer segments that would benefit. Do not limit your thinking to the founder's hypothesis. Think from scratch: who suffers most from the core problem, or who stands to gain the most from this specific solution?

Step 2: Data-Driven Filtering and Evaluation
Research and evaluate each brainstormed segment against the following critical, unbiased criteria. Your goal is to find the segment with the most urgent need and best fit.

Acute & Quantifiable Pain: Does this segment experience the core problem in a severe, frequent, and measurable way? Is the cost of inaction high for them?

Financial Capacity: Can this segment realistically afford and approve the product's price point?

Market & Timing ("Tailwinds"): Are there specific trends, new regulations, or market shifts that make this solution particularly relevant for this segment right now?

Secondary Value Alignment: Does this segment strongly value the product's secondary benefits (e.g., data insights, ease of use, design, compliance, status)?

Market Accessibility: How easy is it to identify and reach decision-makers within this segment through focused marketing and sales efforts?

Step 3: ICP Synthesis and Recommendation
Based on your evaluation in Step 2, identify and rank the Top N most promising ICPs.

For EACH of the Top N ICPs, provide a detailed profile that includes:

ICP Definition: A highly specific description (e.g., industry, company size, user role, specific characteristics).

Primary Buying Driver: The single most powerful motivator for this specific ICP to purchase.

Supporting Evidence & Reasoning: Justify why this is a top ICP, referencing your Step 2 analysis and any relevant market data for the specified geographic region.

A "Hook" for Marketing: Suggest a single, compelling marketing message or question that would immediately grab this ICP's attention.

The final output should be a clear, structured report presenting the Top N ICPs as your primary, data-driven recommendation.
