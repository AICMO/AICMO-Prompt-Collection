Survey Question:
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product Name]?"
- Very disappointed (40%+ target for PMF)
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A - I no longer use [Product Name]

Follow-up Questions:
1. "What type of person do you think would most benefit from [Product Name]?"
2. "What is the main benefit you receive from [Product Name]?"
3. "How can we improve [Product Name] for you?"

Survey Implementation:
- Timing: After 2-4 weeks of usage (sufficient experience)
- Sample Size: 100+ responses for statistical significance
- Frequency: Monthly tracking for trends
- Segmentation: By customer type, usage level, tenure
- Distribution: In-app, email, or phone interview

Results Analysis:
Quarter 1: 23% "Very Disappointed" (Below PMF threshold)
Quarter 2: 38% "Very Disappointed" (Approaching PMF)
Quarter 3: 47% "Very Disappointed" (PMF Achievement)
Quarter 4: 52% "Very Disappointed" (Strong PMF)

Segment Breakdown:
- Enterprise Users: 61% "Very Disappointed" (Strong PMF)

```

**Net Promoter Score Tracking:**
```
NPS-Based PMF Measurement

NPS Survey Question:
"How likely are you to recommend [Product Name] to a friend or colleague?"
Scale: 0-10 (Detractors: 0-6, Passives: 7-8, Promoters: 9-10)

PMF Interpretation:
- NPS > 70: Excellent PMF (strong advocacy)
- NPS 50-70: Good PMF (satisfied customers)
- NPS 30-50: Moderate PMF (room for improvement)
- NPS < 30: Poor PMF (significant issues)

Longitudinal NPS Tracking:
Month 1: NPS = 12 (Poor PMF, high detractor rate)
Month 3: NPS = 28 (Improving, reducing detractors)
Month 6: NPS = 45 (Moderate PMF, increasing promoters)
Month 9: NPS = 63 (Good PMF, strong word-of-mouth)
Month 12: NPS = 71 (Excellent PMF, advocacy-driven growth)
