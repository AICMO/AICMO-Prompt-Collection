- Market Position: [LEADER/CHALLENGER/PREMIUM/VALUE]
- Customer Segments: [PRICE SENSITIVE/VALUE FOCUSED/PREMIUM]
- Testing Scope: [NEW PRODUCT/EXISTING/MARKET EXPANSION]
- Timeline: [TEST DURATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE]

**Complete Price Testing Framework:**

**1. PRICE TESTING STRATEGY DESIGN:**

**Testing Objectives Definition:**

**Revenue Optimization:**
- **Maximum Revenue**: Find price point that maximizes total revenue
- **Profit Maximization**: Optimize for highest profit margins
- **Market Share**: Balance price and volume for share growth
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Optimize for long-term customer value
- **Competitive Response**: Test pricing strategies vs. competitive moves

**Market Research Goals:**
- **Price Elasticity**: Understand demand response to price changes
- **Customer Segments**: Identify different price sensitivities by segment
- **Value Perception**: Measure customer willingness-to-pay
- **Competitive Position**: Assess pricing vs. alternatives
- **Feature-Price Trade-offs**: Understand what customers value most

**Test Design Framework:**
```
Price Testing Design Template:

Hypothesis: "Increasing price by X% will result in Y% revenue change"
Test Group: New pricing strategy
Control Group: Current pricing strategy
Success Metrics: Revenue, conversion rate, customer acquisition
Sample Size: 1000+ customers per group (for statistical significance)
Test Duration: 4-8 weeks (minimum 2 business cycles)
Statistical Power: 80% power to detect 10% revenue difference
Confidence Level: 95% (5% significance level)
```

**2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN METHODOLOGIES:**

**A/B Testing Framework:**

**Simple A/B Price Test:**
```
Test Design:
Control Group (50%): Current price of $100
Test Group (50%): New price of $120 (+20%)

Measurements:
- Conversion rate (% of visitors who purchase)
- Revenue per visitor (average transaction value)
- Customer acquisition volume
- Customer quality (lifetime value)

Success Criteria:
Revenue per visitor increase >10% to justify price increase
Conversion rate decrease <15% to maintain volume
Customer LTV maintained or improved
```

**Multi-Variant Testing:**
```
Four-Way Price Test:
Group A (25%): $80 (20% decrease)
Group B (25%): $100 (current price)
Group C (25%): $120 (20% increase)  
Group D (25%): $140 (40% increase)

Analysis Framework:
- Plot demand curve across price points
- Calculate revenue optimization point
- Identify price elasticity coefficients
- Segment analysis by customer characteristics
```

**Package Testing:**
```
Feature-Price Bundle Tests:
Option A: Basic package - $50 (limited features)
Option B: Standard package - $100 (current offering)
Option C: Premium package - $150 (enhanced features)
Option D: Ultimate package - $200 (full features + service)

Measurements:
- Package selection rates
- Average revenue per customer
- Feature utilization and satisfaction
- Upgrade and cross-sell rates
```

**3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

**Price Elasticity Calculation:**
```
Price Elasticity of Demand = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price

Example Calculation:
Price increase: $100 to $120 (+20%)
Demand decrease: 1000 to 900 units (-10%)
Elasticity = -10% / +20% = -0.5

Interpretation:
Elasticity of -0.5 = Inelastic demand
1% price increase causes 0.5% demand decrease
Revenue increases with price increases
```

**Revenue Optimization Analysis:**
```
Revenue = Price × Quantity
Revenue = P × Q(P) where Q(P) is demand function

Optimization:
Find price P that maximizes P × Q(P)
Use calculus: dRevenue/dPrice = 0
Or test multiple price points empirically

Example Results:
$80 price: 1200 units = $96,000 revenue
$100 price: 1000 units = $100,000 revenue  
$120 price: 900 units = $108,000 revenue (optimal)
$140 price: 750 units = $105,000 revenue
```

**Statistical Significance Testing:**
```
T-Test for Revenue Difference:
H0: Revenue_test = Revenue_control (no difference)
H1: Revenue_test ≠ Revenue_control (significant difference)

Required Sample Size:
n = (Z₁₋α/₂ + Z₁₋β)² × (σ₁² + σ₂²) / (μ₁ - μ₂)²

Where:
Z₁₋α/₂ = 1.96 (for 95% confidence)
Z₁₋β = 0.84 (for 80% power)
σ = standard deviation of revenue
μ = mean revenue per customer
```

**4. SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING:**

**Customer Segment Analysis:**

        demand_curve = self.demand_model.predict(
            price_range=[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100],
            segment=customer_segment,
            conditions=market_conditions
        )
        
        # Calculate expected revenue for each price point
        revenue_curve = []
        for price, demand in demand_curve:
            revenue = price * demand
            revenue_curve.append((price, revenue))
            
        # Account for competitive response
        competitive_impact = self.competitor_model.predict_response(revenue_curve)
        
        # Return optimal price
        optimal_price = max(revenue_curve, key=lambda x: x[1] * competitive_impact)
