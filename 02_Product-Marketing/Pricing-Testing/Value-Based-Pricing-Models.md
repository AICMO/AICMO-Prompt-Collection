Create a comprehensive value-based pricing model for: [PRODUCT/SERVICE/SOLUTION]

**Pricing Strategy Context:**
- Product/Service: [WHAT YOU'RE PRICING]
- Market Position: [PREMIUM/COMPETITIVE/VALUE/DISRUPTOR]
- Customer Segments: [PRIMARY TARGET MARKETS]
- Value Drivers: [KEY CUSTOMER BENEFITS]
- Competitive Landscape: [PRICING BENCHMARKS]
- Business Model: [SUBSCRIPTION/TRANSACTION/LICENSE/USAGE]

**Complete Value-Based Pricing Framework:**

**1. VALUE QUANTIFICATION FOUNDATION:**

**Customer Value Analysis:**

**Economic Value to Customer (EVC) Calculation:**
```
EVC = Reference Value + Differentiation Value
Where:
Reference Value = Cost of best alternative solution
Differentiation Value = Quantified benefits of your unique advantages

Example:
Reference Value (Competitor): $100,000 annually
Differentiation Value:
- Efficiency gains: $50,000 saved labor costs
- Quality improvements: $30,000 reduced errors
- Speed advantages: $20,000 faster time-to-market
Total EVC = $100,000 + $100,000 = $200,000
Optimal Price Range = $120,000 - $180,000 (60-90% of EVC)
```

**Value Driver Identification:**
- **Functional Value**: Tangible performance improvements and cost savings
- **Emotional Value**: Confidence, security, pride, and satisfaction benefits
- **Social Value**: Status, recognition, and relationship advantages
- **Economic Value**: Revenue generation, cost reduction, and ROI benefits

**Value Measurement Framework:**
For each value driver, quantify:
- **Baseline Performance**: Current state without your solution
- **Improved Performance**: Expected state with your solution
- **Performance Delta**: Quantified improvement and benefit
- **Financial Impact**: Revenue, cost, or efficiency value in dollars
- **Probability**: Likelihood of achieving the value (risk adjustment)

**2. CUSTOMER WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY ANALYSIS:**

**Price Sensitivity Research:**

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Analysis:**
Survey questions to determine price acceptance:
- **"At what price would this be so expensive that you wouldn't consider it?"** (Too Expensive)
- **"At what price would you consider this expensive but still worth considering?"** (Expensive/High Quality)
- **"At what price would you consider this a bargain?"** (Cheap/Good Value)  
- **"At what price would this be so cheap that you'd question the quality?"** (Too Cheap)

**Analysis Results:**
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP)**: Intersection of "Too Expensive" and "Too Cheap"
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP)**: Intersection of "Expensive" and "Cheap"
- **Range of Acceptable Prices**: Between "Too Cheap" and "Too Expensive"
- **Price Sensitivity**: Steepness of curves indicates sensitivity level

**Conjoint Analysis for Feature-Price Trade-offs:**
```
Attribute Levels:
Price: $50K, $75K, $100K, $125K
Feature Set: Basic, Standard, Premium
Implementation: Self-service, Guided, Full-service
Support: Community, Business Hours, 24/7

Customer Preferences:
Feature Set: 40% importance
Price: 35% importance  
Support: 15% importance
Implementation: 10% importance

Optimal Configuration:
Premium Features + $100K Price + Business Hours Support = Highest Utility
```

**3. PRICING MODEL DEVELOPMENT:**

**Value-Based Pricing Structures:**

**Performance-Based Pricing:**
Price tied directly to value delivered:
- **Results Sharing**: Percentage of customer savings or revenue gains
- **Outcome Guarantees**: Payment contingent on achieving specific results
- **Success Fees**: Bonus payments for exceeding performance targets
- **Risk Sharing**: Reduced upfront cost with performance-based payments

**Example Performance Pricing:**
```
Base Price: $50,000 (covers implementation and basic service)
Performance Bonus: 20% of documented savings above $200,000
Maximum Annual Payment: $150,000 (cap prevents excessive costs)
Minimum Guarantee: Customer saves at least $200,000 or receives refund
```

**Value Tier Pricing:**
Different price points based on value delivered:
- **Basic Tier**: Core functionality at competitive price point
- **Professional Tier**: Enhanced features at premium but justified price
- **Enterprise Tier**: Full capabilities at value-based premium pricing
- **Custom Tier**: Tailored solutions at negotiated value-based pricing

**Usage-Based Value Pricing:**
Price scales with customer value realization:
- **Transaction-Based**: Price per transaction or interaction
- **Outcome-Based**: Price per successful outcome or result
- **Consumption-Based**: Price based on actual usage and value consumption
- **Hybrid Model**: Combination of base fee plus usage/performance pricing

**4. COMPETITIVE PRICING STRATEGY:**

**Competitive Value Positioning:**

**Price-Value Mapping:**
```

                   ______|______
    High Price     C     |     D     Low Price
                         |
                    Low Value

Quadrant A: High Value, Low Price = Value Leader
Quadrant B: High Value, High Price = Premium Position  
Quadrant C: Low Value, High Price = Overpriced
Quadrant D: Low Value, Low Price = Economy Position
```

**Competitive Advantage Pricing:**

### 3. Psychological Pricing Strategies

```
Create pricing frameworks that leverage psychological principles for optimal customer response:

**Psychological Pricing Framework:**
- Pricing Psychology: [ANCHORING/LOSS AVERSION/SOCIAL PROOF/DECOY EFFECT]
- Customer Behavior: [RATIONAL/EMOTIONAL/SOCIAL DECISION MAKING]
- Price Presentation: [BUNDLING/UNBUNDLING/TIERING/FRAMING]
- Decision Context: [INDIVIDUAL/COMMITTEE/PROCUREMENT/BUDGET]

**Psychological Pricing Principles:**

**ANCHORING EFFECT IN PRICING:**

**High Anchor Strategy:**
Present highest-value option first to establish anchor:
```
Premium Package: $150,000 (Full enterprise solution)
Professional Package: $75,000 (Standard solution) ← Appears reasonable
Basic Package: $35,000 (Entry-level solution)
```

**Value Anchoring:**
Anchor on value delivered rather than cost:
```
"This solution will save you $500,000 annually"
"Our price is $100,000" ← Seems small compared to $500,000 value
"That's a 5:1 return on your investment"
```

**Competitive Anchoring:**
Use competitor pricing as reference point:
```
"Competitor charges $80,000 for basic functionality"
"We provide 3x more value for $90,000"
"That's 300% more value for only 12.5% more investment"
```

**LOSS AVERSION PRICING:**

**Opportunity Cost Framing:**
Frame price as preventing larger losses:
```
"Prevent $2M in annual losses for $200,000 investment"
"Stop losing $500,000 per year in inefficiencies"
"Avoid $1M compliance penalty risk"
```

**Status Quo Cost:**
Emphasize cost of current situation:
```
"Current manual process costs $300,000 annually"
"Our solution costs $150,000 - saving you $150,000 per year"
"Continuing current approach will cost $1.5M over 5 years"
```

**SOCIAL PROOF PRICING:**

**Peer Pricing Validation:**
"Companies like yours typically invest $100,000-150,000 in solutions like this"
"Industry leaders spend an average of $200,000 on this capability"
"95% of our customers consider this their best investment"

**Success Story Pricing:**
"[Similar Company] invested $120,000 and generated $600,000 in returns"
"Our average customer sees 4:1 ROI within 18 months"
"[Industry Leader] said this was their most profitable investment"

**DECOY EFFECT PRICING:**

**Three-Tier Strategy:**
```
Basic: $50,000 (Limited features, makes Premium look comprehensive)
Premium: $75,000 (Target option - best value) ← Customer choice
Enterprise: $125,000 (Full features, makes Premium seem reasonably priced)
```

**Feature Decoy:**
```
Competitor A: $60,000 (Basic features)
Competitor B: $120,000 (Premium features, expensive)
Your Solution: $80,000 (Premium features, better value) ← Clear winner
```

**PRICE PRESENTATION OPTIMIZATION:**

**Bundling vs. Unbundling:**
```
Bundled Presentation:
"Complete solution package: $100,000"
(Seems like one large expense)

Unbundled Presentation:
"Software: $40,000 + Implementation: $30,000 + Training: $15,000 + Support: $15,000"
(Seems like multiple smaller, justified expenses)
```

**Payment Term Psychology:**
```
Annual Payment: "$120,000 per year"
Monthly Payment: "$10,000 per month" (seems smaller)
Daily Cost: "$329 per day" (seems trivial)
Per-Employee: "$50 per employee per month" (personal scale)
```

Apply psychological pricing to: [SPECIFIC PRODUCT/CUSTOMER SEGMENT]
