Create a comprehensive ROI calculator system for: [PRODUCT/SERVICE/SOLUTION]

**ROI Calculator Context:**
- Solution Type: [SOFTWARE/SERVICE/TECHNOLOGY/CONSULTING]
- Target Market: [SMB/MID-MARKET/ENTERPRISE]
- Typical Investment: [PRICE RANGE AND MODEL]
- Value Drivers: [KEY BENEFITS AREAS]
- Payback Expectations: [CUSTOMER TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS]
- Decision Makers: [FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL/BUSINESS BUYERS]

**Complete ROI Calculator Framework:**

**1. FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**

**Revenue Impact Calculations:**

**Revenue Growth Opportunities:**
- **New Revenue Streams**: Additional products/services enabled
- **Market Expansion**: Geographic or demographic growth
- **Customer Acquisition**: Improved lead generation and conversion
- **Customer Retention**: Reduced churn and increased loyalty
- **Upselling/Cross-selling**: Increased customer lifetime value
- **Pricing Optimization**: Premium pricing through value delivery

**Revenue Calculation Framework:**
```
New Revenue = (Baseline Revenue × Growth Rate) - Baseline Revenue
Growth Rate = (Conversion Improvement + Retention Improvement + Expansion Rate)

Example:
Current Annual Revenue: $10M
Solution Impact: 15% improvement in customer acquisition, 10% retention increase
New Revenue = ($10M × 1.25) - $10M = $2.5M additional annual revenue
```

**Cost Reduction Opportunities:**

**Operational Cost Savings:**
- **Labor Efficiency**: Reduced manual work and automation
- **Process Optimization**: Streamlined workflows and elimination of waste
- **Error Reduction**: Decreased mistakes and rework costs
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of existing assets
- **Vendor Consolidation**: Reduced supplier costs and complexity
- **Compliance Savings**: Reduced regulatory and audit costs

**Cost Savings Calculation Framework:**
```
Annual Cost Savings = (Current Process Cost - Optimized Process Cost) × Frequency
Process Cost = (Labor Hours × Hourly Rate) + (Error Rate × Error Cost) + Overhead

Example:
Current manual process: 40 hours/month × $50/hour = $2,000/month
Automated process: 5 hours/month × $50/hour = $250/month
Monthly savings: $1,750 × 12 months = $21,000 annual savings
```

**Risk Mitigation Value:**

**Risk Cost Quantification:**
- **Security Breaches**: Average cost of data breach or downtime
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory fines and penalties
- **Quality Issues**: Cost of defects, recalls, or customer dissatisfaction
- **Operational Disruptions**: Downtime cost and business interruption
- **Talent Risks**: Recruitment, training, and retention costs
- **Market Risks**: Competitive disadvantage and lost opportunities

**Risk Value Framework:**
```
Risk Mitigation Value = Probability of Risk × Impact Cost × Mitigation Factor
Impact Cost = (Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Opportunity Costs)

Example:
Data breach risk: 15% probability × $2M average cost × 80% mitigation = $240K value
Compliance violation: 25% probability × $500K penalty × 90% mitigation = $112.5K value
Total risk mitigation value: $352.5K annually
```

**2. INVESTMENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):**

**Direct Investment Costs:**
- **Software Licenses**: Initial and ongoing subscription costs
- **Implementation Services**: Setup, configuration, customization
- **Training Costs**: User education and certification programs
- **Integration Expenses**: API development and system connections
- **Hardware Requirements**: Additional infrastructure if needed
- **Migration Costs**: Data transfer and system conversion

**Ongoing Operational Costs:**
- **Maintenance and Support**: Annual support fees and upgrades
- **Personnel Costs**: Dedicated staff or additional responsibilities
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Hosting, security, backup requirements
- **Third-party Integrations**: Additional tools and services
- **Compliance Costs**: Audits, certifications, regulatory requirements
- **Upgrade Costs**: Future enhancements and version updates

**TCO Calculation Model:**
```
Year 1 TCO = Initial Investment + Implementation + Training + Integration
Ongoing Annual TCO = Subscription + Support + Personnel + Infrastructure
3-Year TCO = Year 1 TCO + (2 × Ongoing Annual TCO)

Example:
Year 1: $100K software + $50K implementation + $20K training = $170K
Ongoing: $50K subscription + $30K support + $40K personnel = $120K/year
3-Year TCO: $170K + (2 × $120K) = $410K
```

**3. ROI CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES:**

**Simple ROI Formula:**
```
ROI = (Financial Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100
Payback Period = Total Investment / Annual Net Benefit

Example:
Annual Benefits: $500K (revenue + savings + risk mitigation)
3-Year Investment: $410K
ROI = ($1.5M - $410K) / $410K × 100 = 266%
Payback Period = $410K / $500K = 0.82 years (10 months)
```

**Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis:**
```
NPV = Σ(Cash Flow_t / (1 + Discount Rate)^t) - Initial Investment
Where t = time period (years)

Example with 10% discount rate:
Year 0: -$170K (initial investment)
Year 1: $330K benefit - $120K ongoing cost = $210K net
Year 2: $350K benefit - $120K ongoing cost = $230K net  
Year 3: $370K benefit - $120K ongoing cost = $250K net

NPV = -$170K + $210K/1.1 + $230K/1.21 + $250K/1.331 = $369K
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
```
IRR is the discount rate where NPV = 0
Use financial calculator or Excel IRR function
IRR represents the annual return rate of the investment

Example:
If IRR = 85%, the investment returns 85% annually
Compare to company's cost of capital (typically 8-15%)
```
