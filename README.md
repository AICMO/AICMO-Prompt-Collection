**We fired our marketing team. This is what we're building instead.**

Welcome and Thank you for your incredible interest in the AI-Automated Marketing Department.

We lived that crisis. We hired the expensive agencies. We burned cash on "growth hacks" that went nowhere. We tried to play the game.

And we failed.

So we're building a new game. We're solving the problem with code.

## The Fully Automated Marketing Department & Autonomous Marketing Engine (AME)

This repository is building a future where marketing is not managed and executed by people, but by a system. We are creating a fully autonomous marketing department composed of AI agents, automated pipelines, and executable playbooks. Our goal is to replace every traditional marketing function. From C-suite strategy to creative execution - with AI, Agents and Code.


We are building an open-source answer to the closed, expensive "agentic" platforms being developed by tech giants like Salesforce and HubSpot. While they build walled gardens, we're giving the keys to everyone.

The traditional marketing organization is a complex ecosystem of human expertise. We are systematically designing AI to automate nearly every task.

## The Mission: An Autonomous System

The mission isn't another "copilot" to help your existing team work faster. This is the replacement for the team itself.

The Autonomous Marketing Engine (AME) is a new paradigm designed to build and run your entire go-to-market strategy on autopilot.

## What's Coming

We are building the AME in focused modules, each engineered to automate a core marketing pillar:

- **01_The AI CMO**: The strategic brain. Automates planning, forecasting, and ROI analysis.

- **02_Product Marketing Bot**: The GTM engine. Automates product launches from research to sales enablement.

- **03_The Infinite Content Engine**: The creative factory. Generates endless, high-quality content on demand.

- **04_The Growth Hacking Swarm**: The pipeline filler. A swarm of bots designed to find and nurture leads 24/7.

- **05_The MarOps AI**: The central nervous system. Manages the data, workflows, and analytics that power the engine.

- **06_Market-Specific Playbooks**: Specialized weapons. Pre-built strategies for B2B, B2C, SaaS, and D2C.

- **07_The AI Governance Layer**: Command & Control. The ethical guardrails and orchestration layer for the agents.

## Join the Revolution ⭐️
