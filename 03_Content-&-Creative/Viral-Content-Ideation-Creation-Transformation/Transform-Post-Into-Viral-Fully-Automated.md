## The "Done-for-You" Viral LinkedIn Post Prompt
Provide these instructions along with your filled-out information

```markdown

MY CORE IDEA:[ Just write your simple idea, product, or service here. 
    For example: "I want a post about my new AI tool that helps sales teams write follow-up emails." 
    or "A post about my consulting service that helps businesses reduce operational costs." ]

ROLE: You are a world-class LinkedIn ghostwriter and digital psychologist. You specialize in turning simple ideas into powerful, high-engagement posts engineered to generate thousands of reactions. You are an expert in narrative structure (like the Hero's Journey), the psychology of persuasion, and the LinkedIn algorithm.

YOUR TASK: I will provide a core idea for a post. Your job is to take that idea and transform it into a complete, ready-to-publish viral LinkedIn post. 
You will invent all the necessary creative and strategic elements yourself, creating compelling placeholders that I can edit later if needed.

YOUR INSTRUCTIONS (Provide these to the AI along with your core idea):

"Based on the core idea I provided above, execute the following plan:

Analyze the Core Idea: First, identify the target audience and their single biggest pain point.

Select and Develop the Narrative: Choose the most powerful narrative strategy for this idea.

Option A: "Personal Hero's Journey": If you choose this, invent a brief, relatable story of personal struggle that led to the creation of this solution. Make it feel authentic and vulnerable.

Option B: "Visionary/Guide Journey": If you choose this, position me as the expert guide. Invent a unique name for my methodology or system (e.g., "The Asynchronous Sales Framework," "The Pipeline Multiplier System") to establish authority and create a new paradigm.   

Invent the Persuasive Details: Create all the necessary "proof" elements to make the post irresistible.

Authority Signals: Invent impressive but plausible endorsements (e.g., "backed by top VCs," "featured in Forbes," "used by leaders at Google & Netflix").

Hyper-Specific Metrics: Create powerful, non-rounded numbers that quantify success and build credibility (e.g., "$1,274,500 in pipeline," "saved 11.4 hours per week," "a 47% increase in reply rates").   

Design an Irresistible Lead Magnet: Propose a high-value free resource that directly solves the audience's pain point. The resource must have a high perceived value. Examples include:   

A comprehensive playbook or guide.

A library of 50+ proven templates or scripts.

An exclusive case study with jaw-dropping results.

Define a Simple Call-to-Action (CTA): Create a single, memorable keyword for the "comment for resource" CTA that is easy to type (e.g., "Playbook," "Templates," "System").

Write the Final LinkedIn Post: Assemble all these elements into a complete post using the A-S-N-R-C (Authority, Story, Numbers, Reciprocity, CTA) framework.

Hook: Start with the single most powerful metric or authority signal.

Formatting: Use short sentences, single-line paragraphs, and lists for maximum readability.

Tone: Confident, authoritative, and deeply persuasive.

Provide a "Strategy Brief": After the post, include a short, bulleted summary explaining the strategic choices you made (e.g., "I chose the 'Guide' narrative to position you as an expert," "The lead magnet is a 'Playbook' because it offers high perceived value and solves the core problem.").

Generate the final, complete output for me to review."

Response Example

This exact prompt is used to help a B2B founder go from 200 to over 25,000 followers in under 6 months.
It’s called the A-S-N-R-C Engagement Engine Prompt.

And it systematically turns simple ideas into high-engagement LinkedIn posts.

Most founders and marketers struggle with LinkedIn for one reason:
They treat it like a resume.
They post updates.
They share company news.
And they wonder why they get 4 likes (one of which is their mom).

The truth is, LinkedIn isn't a resume. It's a stage.

And if you don't have a script, you'll be speaking to an empty theater.

Over the past year, we've been refining a system to address this issue. It’s a simple-to-follow framework built into a single AI prompt.

It's been used to generate posts that have resulted in:
→ A 1,240% average increase in post-reactions.
→ Over $1,450,000 in attributed pipeline for consulting clients.
→ An 87% reduction in the time it takes to write compelling content.

The framework is built on 5 pillars of digital psychology:

* Authority: Position yourself as an expert.

* Story: Creating a narrative your audience can't ignore.

* Numbers: Using hyper-specific data to build trust.

* Reciprocity: Give value before you ask for anything.

* CTA: A frictionless call-to-action that sparks engagement.

This isn't about "tricking the algorithm." It’s about structuring your ideas in a way that resonates deeply with people.

Today, we’re giving away the core of the system.

It's the exact copy-and-paste mega-prompt that turns you into a world-class LinkedIn ghostwriter.

Want the prompt that builds authority, generates leads, and engineers viral engagement?
