        Use formats like "f*ck [old way], do [new way]" or "The real reason you [have a problem]...".
2.  Urgency & FOMO: 
        Create a sense of scarcity or of discovering a secret. 
        Use phrases like "You're telling me I...", "...and I'm JUST now finding this out??", "who was gonna tell me...", or "one year of [activity] and I find this NOW?! üò±".
3.  Relatability & POV: 
        Write from a first-person point of view. 
        Use formats like "POV: you...", "me explaining to my friends...", "girls, let's normalize...", or describe a hyper-specific, relatable situation.
4.  Emotional & Hyperbolic Language: 
        Use dramatic, emotional language. Start hooks with "CRYING," "SOBBING," "HELP," "SHUT UP," or "LITERALLY." 
        Use ALL CAPS and emojis (üò≠, ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚ú®, üò©, ü•∞) for emphasis.
5.  Community & In-Group Focus: 
        Address a specific niche or community directly (e.g., "long distance couples...", "notes app girls...", "solo travelers...").

Keep hooks short and punchy. Provide a variety of options applying different tactics.

3.  The "Discovery" Flex: Frame the app as the answer to a question. Use formats like "how did I not know about this?!" or "(Q: How'd you do that?) A: on [App Name] ofc."
4.  Simple Emotional Affirmations: 
        State a simple, heartfelt belief and connect the app to it. (e.g., "long distance is worth it with this ü•π" or "this is for the notes app girls").
5.  Minimalist & Authentic Voice: Keep it brief. Use lowercase, slang (like "iykyk," "no bc," "obsessed"), and emotional shorthand.
