**Webinar Technology Framework:**

**ENTERPRISE WEBINAR PLATFORM:**

**Webinar Technology Architecture:**
```python
class WebinarTechnologyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.webinar_platform = WebinarPlatform()
        self.registration_system = RegistrationSystem()
        self.crm_integration = CRMIntegration()
        self.analytics_platform = AnalyticsPlatform()
        
    def setup_webinar_infrastructure(self, business_requirements):
        # Configure webinar platform for lead generation
        platform_config = self.webinar_platform.configure_platform(
            capacity_requirements=business_requirements.audience_size,
            engagement_features=business_requirements.interaction_needs,
            recording_capabilities=business_requirements.content_strategy,
            integration_requirements=business_requirements.tech_stack
        )
        
        # Set up registration and lead capture system
        registration_config = self.registration_system.configure_registration(
            lead_qualification=business_requirements.qualification_criteria,
            form_optimization=business_requirements.conversion_goals,
            automation_workflows=business_requirements.follow_up_requirements
        )
        
        # Configure CRM and marketing automation integration
        crm_config = self.crm_integration.configure_integration(
            lead_handoff=business_requirements.sales_process,
            scoring_criteria=business_requirements.qualification_model,
            nurturing_workflows=business_requirements.marketing_automation
