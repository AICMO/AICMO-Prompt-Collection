**Workflow Automation Integration:**
```
Score-Based Workflow Automation

High-Score Lead Workflows (80+ points):
CRM Actions:
- Create high-priority task for sales rep
- Update lead status to "Hot Lead"
- Set follow-up reminder for 5 minutes
- Add to daily sales manager report

Marketing Automation:
- Remove from nurture campaigns
- Add to sales-ready sequence
- Send internal alert to sales team
- Update lead routing for immediate assignment

Email Platform:
- Pause general nurture emails
- Trigger personalized outreach sequence
- Enable sales email templates
- Track email engagement closely

Medium-Score Lead Workflows (50-79 points):
Marketing Automation:
- Continue targeted nurture campaigns
- Increase email frequency and personalization
- Add to demo invitation campaigns
- Track for score threshold breaches

CRM Actions:
- Update lead status to "Warm Lead"
- Create medium-priority task
- Schedule follow-up in 24-48 hours
- Add to weekly sales pipeline review

Low-Score Lead Workflows (Below 50 points):
Marketing Automation:
- Add to educational nurture sequence
- Reduce email frequency to avoid fatigue
- Focus on awareness and education content
- Monitor for engagement improvements

CRM Actions:
- Maintain in "Cold Lead" status
- Create low-priority follow-up task
- Schedule monthly review
- Keep in long-term nurture cycle

### Continuous Optimization

```
Create systematic approaches for ongoing lead scoring model improvement and optimization:

**Optimization Framework:**

**MODEL PERFORMANCE MONITORING:**

**Continuous Learning System:**
```python
class LeadScoringOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        self.model_trainer = ModelTrainer()
        self.a_b_tester = ABTester()
        
    def optimize_scoring_model(self, model_performance_data):
        # Monitor model accuracy and drift
        performance_analysis = self.performance_monitor.analyze_performance(
            model_performance_data
        )
        
        # Detect model degradation
        if performance_analysis.accuracy_decline > 0.05:  # 5% threshold
            # Retrain model with new data
            updated_model = self.model_trainer.retrain_model(
                performance_analysis.recent_data
            )
            
            # A/B test new model against current
            ab_test_results = self.a_b_tester.test_model_performance(
                current_model=performance_analysis.current_model,
                new_model=updated_model,
                test_duration_days=14
            )
            
            # Deploy better performing model
            if ab_test_results.new_model_better:
                self.deploy_new_model(updated_model)
        
        return {
            'performance_analysis': performance_analysis,
            'optimization_actions': self.get_optimization_actions(),
            'model_update_status': self.get_model_status()
        }
```

**Score Calibration and Validation:**
```
Scoring Model Validation Framework

Validation Methodology:
Historical Validation:
- Backtest model on 12 months of historical data
- Compare predicted vs. actual conversion rates
- Analyze score distribution and conversion correlation
- Validate across different time periods and seasons

Prospective Validation:
- Monitor new leads for 90-day conversion tracking
- Compare scoring predictions to actual outcomes
- Measure prediction accuracy by score ranges
- Track false positive and false negative rates

Cross-Validation:
- Split data into training and validation sets
- Test model performance on unseen data
- Validate across different customer segments
- Ensure model generalizes well to new scenarios

Calibration Metrics:
Score Range Accuracy:
- 90-100 points: 85% conversion rate (predicted 90%)
- 80-89 points: 72% conversion rate (predicted 75%)
- 70-79 points: 58% conversion rate (predicted 60%)
- 60-69 points: 42% conversion rate (predicted 45%)

Model Improvement Actions:
- Recalibrate score thresholds based on actual performance
- Adjust feature weights for better prediction accuracy
- Add new behavioral signals and data sources
- Remove or modify underperforming scoring factors
