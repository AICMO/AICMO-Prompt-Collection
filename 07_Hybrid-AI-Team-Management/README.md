# The AI Governance Layer: Orchestrating the Agents

**An autonomous system without guardrails is a liability. This is the command-and-control center.**

As AI agents become capable of executing entire campaigns, the biggest risk shifts from poor performance to catastrophic error. An AI that perpetuates bias, violates privacy regulations, or publishes factually incorrect "hallucinations" can destroy a brand overnight.

This module is the essential governance layer for the entire engine. It is not for managing people; it's for orchestrating a powerful system of AI agents safely and ethically. It provides the checklists, prompt libraries, and human-in-the-loop protocols to ensure the AI works for you, not against you.
